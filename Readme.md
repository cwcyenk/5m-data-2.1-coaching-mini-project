# Group Project 2: Webscraping and Data Analysis 

## Description 

Your goal is the following:

1. Collect data by performing web-scraping + data wrangling. Once you determined the source, make sure you are able to scape the website successfully
2. Formulate a data-science / business problem based on the data you have obtained, present your learnings and interesting takeway using appriopriate visualizations



## Tips

### For Business Case Development:
  - Set a strict 30-minute timer for final business case selection
### For Web Scraping:
- Consider easier targets like product listings rather than complex data
- Use sites with cleaner HTML structure
- Assign specific scraping tasks to different team members



## Presentation Structure


- **Presentation Time: 10 minutes**
- Presentations will a 10 minute presentation. You can use inspiration from the [ignite talks](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) framework to design your presentation (its fun!). Learn more about the [ignite style](https://speakingaboutpresenting.com/content/fast-ignite-presentation/) 
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience.
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

- Why it matters
2. Data Approach 
- Data sources and scraping done
3. Key Findings 
- Visualization and clear learnings
